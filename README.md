Tensorflow Setup Instructions
----------------------
## For Linux and Mac users
+ **Please follow the instructions on this [link](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/get_started/os_setup.html#download-and-setup).**
+ After installing, 
    + Clone this repositor and navigate of that folder
    + Use "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install additional python libraries
    + Open terminal and type "jupyter notebook". (This will open the Jupyter notebook in your local host, usually at **http://localhost:8888/**
    + Open  **HelloWorld/HelloWorld.ipynb** file and run it to test your installation.


## For Windows users
+ **Tensorflow is not available on Windows. So, you'll need to install Docker from [here](https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases/download/v1.12.2/DockerToolbox-1.12.2.exe).**
+ After installing Docker, open **Docker Quickstart Terminal** and type the following.
